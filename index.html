			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p>Hi there, thanks for using the outline to CSV converter.</p>

			<p>Why I chose to convert OPML to CSV instead of native exports of
				mindmap apps is because every mindmap app I've seen has their
				own markup syntax, so in order to support as many apps as
				possible in the shortest time, I opted to support just
				<code>.opml</code> files which is a common export format that
				major mindmap tools support.
			</p>

			<p>This also means the in-app formatting of the mindmaps are lost in
				the process.</p>

			<h3>Notes</h3>

			<p>This app is still being (inactively) developed and there are many
				defects:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>No escape mechanism for most special characters (to be
					added)</li>
				<li>No support for right column alignment, everything is left
					aligned (will add feature to support right columns by
					specifying number of columms to align).</li>
				<li>No build in template headers (the top few rows in QA
					spreadsheet).</li>
				<li>On MacOS, Numbers app will mess up the formatting due to
					implicit assumptions made with delimiter. Probably won't fix
					since Numbers is not the targeted app.</li>
				<li>Very ugly UI here (low priority).</li>
				<li>Not hosted on internal services (can't find GitLab pages,
					not sure if enabled, will also check with platform QA side).
				</li>
			</ol>
